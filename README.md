# GrowDuino
## Synopsis

This is the code used for using Arduino's, MySQL and PHP to monitor pH, Humidity, Room/Water Temperature and Water Level. It also sends alerts if the water level drops, although it's still very basic and will be switching to a better system to monitor water level.

## Motivation

I looked around for ways to monitor the various levels related to Hydroponics but although there's a lot of people working on differant projects, I couldn't find anything that really fit my needs so I decided to just put together my own system.

## Installation

* Apache2
* PHP 7
* MySQL
* [PHPGraphLib](http://www.ebrueggeman.com)
