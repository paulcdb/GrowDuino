## Synopsis

This is the code used for using Arduino's, MySQL and PHP to monitor pH, Humidity, Room/Water Temperature and Water Level. It also sends alerts if the water level drops, although it's still very basic and will be switching to a better system to monitor water level.

## Motivation

I looked around for ways to monitor the various levels related to Hydroponics but although there's a lot of people working on differant projects, I couldn't find anything that really fit my needs so I decided to just put together my own system.

## TODO

There's still a lot to do. 

The website has placeholders for being able to turn the LED lights and pumps on/off, pause the arduino in case of maintanence needs, and a few other things which I won't mention since i'm not sure if it'll be easy to do! 

## Installation

* Apache2
* PHP 7
* MySQL
* [PHPGraphLib](http://www.ebrueggeman.com)

## Note...

I have no real coding skills so I'm sure the code could be done better and you're welcome to tell me how it can be improved. It's one of those things where... it works! so I'm happy!
